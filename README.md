# Cypress basics

This repository serves as a demonstration of the basic features of Cypress. It was created to accompany [this article](https://segbedji.com/testez-vos-spa-avec-cypress/) [FR] which is an introduction to Cypress.

## Running the directory tests
*The tests are located in the `/cypress/integration` folder.*

- Start by installing the packages by doing `npm install`. This will install Cypress. 
- Then run the `npx cypress open` command to launch the Cypress dashboard and run the tests.
